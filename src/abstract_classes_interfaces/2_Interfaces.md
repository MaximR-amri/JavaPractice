# Interfaces

## 1. Write an interface Resizable
* Has a method resize(double x) that resizes a Shape’s dimensions by factor x
## 2. Make Rectangle implement Resizable
## 3. In a Main Class, write a main method to:
* Define a Rectangle (width = 2, height = 3)
* Print the Rectangle‟s area & perimeter
* Resize the Rectangle by factor of 2
* Re-print the Rectangle‟s area & perimeter
